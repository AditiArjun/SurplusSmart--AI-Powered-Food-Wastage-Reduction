SurplusSmart is a project aimed at reducing food wastage using technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The system helps in monitoring food quality, predicting nutrients, and redistributing excess food to people in need.

## Features

- Food quality detection using computer vision
- Nutrients in food prediction using machine learning
- Dashboard for tracking donations and requests
- Alerts for near-expiry or excess food

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- Flask (Backend)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- MySQL (Database)

## How It Works

1. Input food images and donor data.
2. AI model predicts nutrients.
3. System alerts for redistribution.
4. Food is delivered to NGOs or food banks.
